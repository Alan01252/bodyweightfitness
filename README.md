## Synopsis

An app for displaying bodyweightfitness routines.

## Motivation

I wanted something really simple. I like the "swipe left" paradigm and decided to build an app which allowed me to simply swipe through the routine and
tell me what I was doing next, allowing me to concentrate on the routine and not having to keep track of where I am and what comes next.
None of the existing apps seemed to do this and so I thought I'd build my own.

## Installation
